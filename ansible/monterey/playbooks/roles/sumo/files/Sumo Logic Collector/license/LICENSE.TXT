3.        CONFIDENTIALITY
3.1        Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party’s technology or business (hereinafter referred to as “Proprietary Information” of the Disclosing Party).  
3.2        The Receiving Party agrees: (i) not to divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information, (i) to give access to such Proprietary Information solely to those employees with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (iii) to  take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Proprietary Information that the party takes with its own proprietary information, but in no event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information.  The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party, or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party.  Nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing the Proprietary Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order. In any event, Sumo Logic may collect data with respect to and report on aggregate measures of the Services’ performance and other measures to enhance the performance of the Services.
3.3        Customer acknowledges that Sumo Logic does not wish to receive any Proprietary Information from Customer that is not necessary for Sumo Logic to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, unless the parties specifically agree otherwise, Sumo Logic may reasonably presume that any unrelated information received from Customer is not confidential or Proprietary Information.
3.4        Both Parties will have the right to disclose the existence but not the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such disclosure is approved in writing by both Parties prior to such disclosure, or is included in a filing required to be made by a Party with a governmental authority (provided such party will use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order) or is made on a confidential basis as reasonably necessary to potential investors or acquirors.

10.        INDEMNIFICATION
10.1        Sumo Logic shall defend against any claim or lawsuit by an unaffiliated third party (a “Claim”) against Customer to the extent such Claim alleges that the Software downloaded from Sumo Logic and deployed by Customer pursuant to this Agreement  infringes any U.S. intellectual property rights  of such third party, and will indemnify Customer for all judgments finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction, or agreed to in a written settlement agreement signed by Sumo Logic (“Damages”), arising out of such Claim. Sumo Logic will pay attorneys fees and court costs incurred in connection with the action.  Sumo Logic shall have no obligation or liability for any Claim of infringement arising from (a) use of the Software other than in accordance with this Agreement; (b) modification of the Software; (c) combination of the Software with any other products, services, or materials if the Software would not be infringing in the absence of such combination, or (d) failure by Customer to install required updates to the Software as requested by Sumo Logic.  If Sumo Logic believes Customer’s use of the Software under the terms of this Agreement may be enjoined, then Sumo Logic may, at its sole option and expense and as Customer’s sole remedy, either (i) procure for Customer a license to continue using the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the allegedly infringing Software to avoid the infringement; or (iii) terminate the licenses and access to the Software, and refund any Fees.
10.2        Customer shall defend any Claim against Sumo Logic that Customer’s actions in connection with any unauthorized use of the Services or Software violate any applicable law or third party right.  Customer will indemnify Sumo Logic (and its directors, employees and agents) against all Damages awarded against Sumo Logic or agreed to in a written settlement agreement signed by Customer arising out of such Claim.
10.3        The obligations set forth in this Section shall apply only if (i) the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing of a Claim promptly upon learning of or receiving the same; (ii) the indemnified party provides the indemnifying party with reasonable assistance requested by the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party’s expense, for the defense and settlement, if applicable, of any Claim; and (iii) the indemnified party provides the indemnifying party with the exclusive right to control and the authority to settle any Claim, provided, however, that (i) the indemnifying party shall not settle any Claim that admits fault or liability of the indemnified party without the indemnified party’s prior written consent and (ii) the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the matter at its own expense.  

11.        U.S. GOVERNMENT MATTERS
11.1        Notwithstanding anything else, Customer may not provide to Sumo Logic or any other person (whether through the Services or any other means), or export or re-export, or allow the export or re-export of the Services, any data or information, or any software or anything related thereto or any direct product thereof (collectively “Controlled Subject Matter”), in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority.
